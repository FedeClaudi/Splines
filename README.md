# Splines
Spline interpolation in Julia


### TODO
- [x] piecewise interpolation: reduce allocation
- [x] b-splines
  - [ ] allow for `closed=true` like piecewise linear
- [ ] bezier curve
- [ ] algebraic topology to get curve topology from data

- [x] test piecewise linear on 3D and > 3D 


- [ ] write tests
- [ ] write docs
